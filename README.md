# Power BI Company Sales & Returns Analysis Dashboard

## üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on **Sales and Returns Analysis** using Power BI. The dashboard is designed to deliver **actionable business insights** that help stakeholders make informed decisions about sales performance, profitability, and product returns.

The solution includes:
- **Data Modeling with Star Schema:**  
  - **2 Fact Tables:** Sales and Returns  
  - **6-7 Dimension Tables:** Product, Category, Customer, Calendar, Region, etc.
- **ER Diagram:** Designed a relational model where fact tables are connected to dimension tables to support **efficient analytics**.
- **Folder Data Source:** Used Power BI's **Folder Connector** to dynamically combine 3 files into one consolidated dataset (instead of manually uploading each file).
- **Advanced DAX Measures:** Created KPIs and calculated columns to drive insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Dashboards designed with slicers, bar/line charts, cards, and drill-downs.

## üìÇ Data Modeling
- Built an **Enterprise-grade star schema** for efficient reporting.
- Relationships established using:
  - **Primary keys** in dimension tables.
  - **Foreign keys** in fact tables.
- The model supports cross-filtering between multiple tables for dynamic insights.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Two Fact Tables:**  
  1. Sales  
  2. Returns  
- **Dimension Tables:** Product, Category, Date, Customer, Region, etc.
- Used **Power BI Folder Connector** to merge 3 related files seamlessly.

   - Dynamic KPIs powered by DAX.

2. **Returns vs Sales Dashboard:**
